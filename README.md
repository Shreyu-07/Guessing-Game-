Guessing Game 🎮

Welcome to the Guessing Game! This is a fun and interactive word game where two players participate—one as the Typer and the other as the Guesser. The Typer secretly enters a word, which is then scrambled for the Guesser to decode. The game continues until the correct word is guessed or the players decide to stop.
